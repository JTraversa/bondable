---------------------

In order to reduce the friction of launching and attracting liquidity to debt markets, borrowers can utilize bondable to issue, trade, and redeem arbitrary uncollateralized debt.

A when launching a debt market, the borrower simply specifies their bond issuance rate, and maximum debt capacity.

Lenders can then purchase newly issued zero-coupon bonds at the specified rate, or alternatively purchase them on an open YieldSpace AMM market.

Debt is uncollateralized and backed solely by reputation.
